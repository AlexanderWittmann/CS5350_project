Data Set Information:

This is a dataset with SMS messages tagged as either spam or ham

We use 4 attributions (the first 4 columns)

1. {Spam,Ham} with Ham meaning a normal message and Spam being a spam message
2. The SMS message data

The label is the first column in the dataset

After some initial testing I decided to use common words as features for the first part of the project.
I will use the perceptron algorithm with common words to see if there is a linear classifer that can predict if a
SMS message is spam.  The words that I decided to use for features are free,txt,mobile,claim,reply,my,now,but
I took the data and made a new file where the the data is formatted below
All of the features I have are boolean either 1 or 0 if the SMS has the word or not
The last column is the label for the data set

1. free {0,1}
2. txt {0,1}
3. mobile {0,1}
4. claim {0,1}
5. reply {0,1}
6. my {0,1}
7. now {0,1}
8. but {0,1}
9. Spam or Not Spam {-1,1}
